# a graphics device is a place where you can plot things.
# RStudio has a built-in graphics device, 
# but there are others. On a mac, we have the quartz() device
# windows has the windows() device
# linux has x11()

# typing quartz() opens a quartz graphics device
# (you'll need to type windows() or x11() if not on a mac)
# it's possible to set a default graphics device
# to be different from the RStudio one 
# (we won't cover that here)

quartz()
# windows()
# x11()

# if we make a plot, it will go into the most recently 
# opened device
plot(0)

# there is a family of functions dev.*() for controlling 
# the graphics deivce we will use dev.off() in this session
dev.off()   # closes most recent device
plot(0)
dev.list()  # lists the open graphical devices
quartz()
dev.list()
dev.cur()
graphics.off()  # closes all of them


# the graphics device has a set of graphical parameters
# that can be viewed as set with the par() function
par()
?par

# plot.new() opens up a graphics device with an empty plot
plot.new()

# plot() can be used to put things in the plot window
# if no device is open, it opens a new graphics device, 
# otherwise, it puts the plot in the most recently 
# opened device
plot(1:10,10:1)
# this uses all of the defaults for everything

# but we can change anything we want
par(font=5,col="magenta",ann=FALSE,bg="gray")

# some aspects of the plot can be set within the plot() 
# function but sometimes they take on different meanings, 
# so be careful

# plots can be created as above and then be saved by

# it much easier to change figures after reviewers 
# ask for changes

# The postscript produced for a single R plot is EPS 
# (Encapsulated PostScript) compatible, and can be 
# included into other documents, e.g., into LaTeX, 
# using \includegraphics{<filename>}. For use in 
# this way you will probably want to use setEPS() 
# to set the defaults as horizontal = FALSE, 
# onefile = FALSE, paper = "special".
